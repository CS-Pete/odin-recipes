#### odin-recipes

This is my first project on TOP. The project involves building a recipes website. Previously, I have build simple TOP-guided pages to demo HTML tags and elements.

So far, I have mainly learnt about HTML and I think that this first version of the website will be a good learning and paracticing experience particularly in regards to HTML.

We have touched on CSS and JS but not deep enough to integrate either of these languages into this project. 

I am still having some trouble pushing all commits to Github. I will review the workflow again but for now I should focus on using 'git add filename*' instead of 'git add .' for file staging.

<u>Reflections</u>

Iteration 3 had some text formatting and different lists which reminded me to study and refer to the following resources in future projects:
