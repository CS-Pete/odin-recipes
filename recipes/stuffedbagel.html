    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Try this Hot Honey Butter Cream Cheese Stuffed Bagel for a quick and
        tasty twist on breakfast! Slice a bagel halfway into 8 sections, then
        stuff each with a piece of cream cheese. Mix melted butter with hot
        honey, slather it all over the bagel, and sprinkle with flaky salt if
        you like. Pop it in the air fryer at 390°F for 5-7 minutes until it’s
        golden and caramelized. Finish with an extra drizzle of honey for a
        deliciously sweet and tangy treat!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 bagel</li>
        <li>1 ounce cream cheese, cut into 8 slices</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot honey or regular honey, plus more for drizzle</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Flaky salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Air Fryer:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your air fryer to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C)
                    according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Bagel:
            <ul>
                <li>Using a sharp knife, make 8 small cuts in the bagel. Be
                    careful not to cut all the way through; these cuts create
                    small openings or pockets in the bagel.</li>
                <li>Insert a slice of cream cheese into each of these small
                    openings around the bagel.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Coat with Honey Butter Mixture:
            <ul>
                <li>In a small dish, combine the hot honey (or regular honey)
                    with melted butter.</li>
                <li>Liberally coat the stuffed bagel with this honey butter
                    mixture, ensuring all surfaces are covered.</li>
                <li>Optionally, sprinkle a pinch of flaky salt over the bagel
                    for added flavor (if desired).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Air Fry the Bagel:
            <ul>
                <li>Place the prepared bagel into the preheated air fryer
                    basket.</li>
                <li>Air fry the bagel until it turns golden brown and crisp,
                    which typically takes about 5 to 7 minutes. Cooking time may
                    vary slightly depending on your air fryer model, so keep an
                    eye on it to prevent overcooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the bagel is cooked to your desired crispness, remove
                    it from the air fryer.</li>
                <li>Optionally, drizzle more honey over the top for extra
                    sweetness and presentation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy:
            <ul>
                <li>Your Hot Honey Butter Cream Cheese Stuffed Bagel is now
                    ready to be enjoyed! Serve it warm for the best experience.
