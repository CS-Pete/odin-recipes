    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour,
            baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Combine Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, mix the buttermilk,
            brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Add the wet ingredients to the dry
            ingredients, stirring until just combined. Fold in the grated carrot
            and melted butter until evenly incorporated. Set the batter aside.
        </li>
        <li>Make Cream Cheese Frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together the
            softened cream cheese, milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract
            until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare Topping: In a small bowl, mix together the golden raisins,
            toasted nuts, coconut flakes, and candied ginger (if using). Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Heat Griddle: Preheat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over
            medium heat and grease it with butter.</li>
        <li>Cook Pancakes: Scoop 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the griddle.
            Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look dry, about
            2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another minute, or until the pancakes
            are fluffy and slightly firm. Repeat with the remaining batter,
            adding more butter to the griddle as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve Pancakes: Divide the pancakes evenly among plates. Drizzle the
            cream cheese frosting over the top and sprinkle with the prepared
            topping.</li>
    </ol>
